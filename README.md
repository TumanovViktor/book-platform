Book platform - project for CZU PEF

Installation:
1. Install Node.js
2. Clone project and open in intelliJ as gradle project
3. Intellij will (I hope) suggest applying angular framework. It means it will create run configuation.
4. To run backend, just open BookPlatformApplication and click green triangle.

Ng-bootstrap dependency is added for frontend, very easy use of CSS components, completele no-brainer.
